# Persistent Memory in Agents

*How memory enables context-aware, evolving agents*

- Introduction to persistent memory: its role in agent engineering  
- Types of memory: short-term, long-term, episodic, and semantic  
- Memory storage and retrieval: techniques and technologies (e.g., vector stores)  
- Integrating memory with agent behavior and learning  
- exploration of how agents adapt to individual users over time: learning user preferences, adapting behavior, balancing personalization with privacy
