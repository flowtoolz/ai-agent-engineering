# Orchestration Strategies for Agent Workflows

*Coordinating complex agent tasks*

- Understanding orchestration: managing state, tools, and memory  
- Patterns: linear workflows, branching logic, Decision trees, parallel execution  
- Memory-driven orchestration: leveraging persistent memory for continuity  
- "The master prompt": using a central prompt to guide agent behavior  
- hierarchical task decomposition
- ML for smarter workflows: predicting and optimizing next steps  
- Overcoming challenges: loops, resource constraints, and failures
- Multi-step reasoning and planning
- Tool selection and usage
- ReAct patterns (Reasoning + Acting)
- Dynamic path exploration
