# Agents: Topic Brainstorm

- key characteristics: autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making
- Differences between agents and traditional static LLMs
- use cases
  - use case categories (assistant, automation, data processor ...)
  - typical use case examples
  - domain-specific examples, like in healthcare, finance, education ...
- multi-agent systems, multi-agent collaboration (architectures, communication protocols, practical examples ...)
- Architecture Patterns for Agent Systems
- Implementation Frameworks: LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, and others
- Deployment essentials: scalability, latency, and cost management
- self-correction (evaluation during orchestrated flows)
- Evaluation
- Building an Agent: A Hands-On Example
- The Future of Agent Engineering
- Business models and monetization strategies
- Data Privacy (compliance with laws like GDPR or HIPAA)
- Data Propriety (what data can I use, how can I obtain data, what data can I use for context/finetuning/training ...)
- Human-Agent Interaction and UX
  - transparency and trust via explainability and interpretability (decision logs, interpretable models ...)
- process and life cycle: ideation, development, testing deployment, maintenance
- Regulatory and Legal Challenges (liability, accountability, compliance with laws like the EU AI Act)
- Scalability and Performance (scaling strategies, performance optimization, cost management ...)
- Multimodal Agents: text, image, audio, speech, video
- Deployment strategies: cloud, edge, on-device, model compression, local embedding generation
