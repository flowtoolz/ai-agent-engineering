# ML Training Paradigms: UL, SL, RL and Hybrids

Machine learning encompasses several fundamental approaches, or paradigms, that define how models learn from data. Among these, supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two of the most prominent, each with distinct methodologies, goals, and applications. This article explores their key differences, delves into hybrid approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and examines how these paradigms are applied in advanced AI techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.

## Introduction to Machine Learning Paradigms

Machine learning is built on a few core paradigms that guide how models are trained and what they aim to achieve. The three foundational paradigms are:

- Supervised Learning (SL): Models learn from labeled data to predict outputs. For example, a model might be trained on images labeled as "cat" or "dog" to classify new images.
- Unsupervised Learning (UL): Models find patterns in unlabeled data, such as grouping similar items without predefined categories.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): Models learn by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, often through trial and error.

In addition to these, there are hybrid paradigms like semi-supervised learning (which uses both labeled and unlabeled data) and self-supervised learning (which generates its own labels from the data structure). However, SL, UL, and RL remain the cornerstones of machine learning.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning uncovers patterns in data without any predefined labels or guidance.

- Data: UL uses unlabeled data, where inputs lack corresponding outputs (e.g., customer purchase histories without categories).
- Feedback: There’s no feedback. The model relies solely on the data’s inherent structure.
- Objective: The goal is to discover hidden patterns or groupings, making UL ideal for tasks like:
  - Clustering: Grouping similar items (e.g., segmenting customers).
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying complex data (e.g., compressing images).
  - Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers (e.g., detecting fraud).

UL shines in applications such as market research (customer segmentation), data preprocessing (feature reduction), and security (anomaly detection).

## Self-Supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning extracts supervision from unlabeled data by creating its own labels.

SSL is technically a sub-category of UL as it uses unlabeled data but generates its own pseudo-labels from that unlabelled data  (e.g., predicting missing words in a sentence or reconstructing parts of an image). It bridges UL and SL by using unsupervised data in a supervised-like way.

- Data: SSL uses unlabeled data, generating pseudo-labels from its structure (e.g., predicting masked words in text).
- Feedback: Feedback is self-generated, based on pretext tasks like reconstruction or prediction, without external labels.
- Objective: The goal is to learn useful representations for later tasks, making SSL ideal for:
- Pre-training: Building general models (e.g., BERT).
- Feature extraction: Enhancing downstream learning.

SSL is widely used in natural language processing (e.g., word embeddings), computer vision (e.g., image pre-training), and model initialization before fine-tuning. The most notable usage is in pre-training LLMs before SL or RLHF refinement.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common paradigm, particularly when labeled data is available. Here’s how it works:

- Data: SL requires a dataset with input features and corresponding correct output labels. For instance, in weather prediction, historical data like temperature and humidity are paired with known outcomes (e.g., whether it rained).
- Feedback: The model receives immediate feedback by comparing its predictions to the correct labels, allowing it to adjust and improve.
- Objective: The goal is to minimize prediction errors on new, unseen data. This makes SL ideal for tasks like:
  - Classification: Categorizing data (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
  - Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).

SL is widely used in applications where structured, labeled data is abundant, such as image recognition, speech-to-text, and weather forecasting.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning takes a fundamentally different approach:

- Data: Instead of labeled data, an agent learns by interacting with an environment. It takes actions and receives rewards or penalties based on the outcomes.
- Feedback: Feedback is often delayed and sparse. For example, in a game, the agent might only receive a reward after completing several moves.
- Objective: The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This requires the agent to learn a strategy (or policy) that leads to the best long-term outcomes.

RL is particularly suited for sequential decision-making problems, such as:

- Game playing (e.g., chess, Go).
- Robotics (e.g., navigating a maze).
- Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving cars).

## Key Differences Between SL and RL

The essential differences between SL and RL can be summarized across several dimensions:

| Aspect                       | Supervised Learning (SL)                     | Reinforcement Learning (RL)                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data                         | Labeled data with input-output pairs             | Interaction with an environment, no labeled data                     |
| Feedback Mechanism           | Immediate feedback for each prediction           | Delayed rewards based on actions                                     |
| Learning Objective           | Minimize prediction errors on new data           | Maximize cumulative rewards over time                                |
| Interaction                  | Passive: learns from a fixed dataset             | Active: actions affect the environment and future states             |
| Feedback Timing              | Immediate                                        | Often delayed, after a sequence of actions                           |
| Exploration vs. Exploitation | No exploration; learns from provided data        | Must balance exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions |
| Problem Type                 | Classification, regression with independent data | Sequential decision-making with long-term consequences               |

These differences highlight why SL is preferred for tasks with clear, labeled data, while RL excels in dynamic, interactive settings where decisions shape future outcomes.

## Weather Prediction: A Case for SL

Weather prediction is a domain where supervised learning is predominantly used. Here’s why:

- Data Availability: Weather forecasting relies on vast amounts of historical data (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity) paired with known outcomes (e.g., rainfall amounts).
- No Interaction: There is no agent making decisions or interacting with the environment to influence future weather states.
- Prediction Task: The goal is to predict future weather conditions based on past patterns, which fits perfectly within the SL framework of learning from labeled examples.

While RL could theoretically be applied in some weather-related optimization tasks (e.g., managing resources in response to weather), it is rarely used in direct weather prediction due to the lack of an interactive decision-making component.

## Is RL a Form of UL?

No, reinforcement learning is not a form of unsupervised learning. Here’s why:

- Unsupervised Learning (UL): Focuses on finding patterns or structures in unlabeled data without any feedback. Common tasks include clustering or dimensionality reduction.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): Involves reward-based feedback from the environment, guiding the agent’s learning process. This feedback distinguishes RL from UL, which has no such guidance.

In essence, RL’s use of rewards makes it distinct from both SL (which uses labels) and UL (which uses neither labels nor rewards).

## Supervised Reinforcement Learning: A Hybrid Concept

Supervised reinforcement learning (SRL) is a theoretical and practical concept that blends elements of SL and RL:

- Idea: An agent explores an environment but receives feedback based on human judgments or labels rather than traditional rewards. For example, a human might rate the agent’s actions or provide optimal moves.
- Applications: This approach is often realized through imitation learning or behavior cloning, where the agent learns from expert demonstrations (a form of labeled data) before refining its policy through RL.

SRL is actively explored in research, though often under related terms like "imitation learning," "behavior cloning," or "guided RL." It is not purely RL; it’s a hybrid that leverages SL’s structured guidance to accelerate RL’s trial-and-error process, especially in scenarios where rewards are sparse or difficult to define.

### Research and Practical Implementations

SRL is actively explored in research, particularly in fields like:

- Robotics: Where human demonstrations help robots learn complex tasks.
- Gaming: As seen in DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which initially learned from expert moves (SL) before improving through self-play (RL).
- Autonomous Systems: Where labeled trajectories guide the learning of optimal policies.

Thus, SRL is not just an interesting idea but a practical approach in modern AI research.

## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): A Blend of SL and RL

RLHF is another hybrid approach that combines RL with human-provided feedback:

- How It Works: The agent learns through RL by maximizing rewards, but these rewards are derived from human judgments (e.g., ratings of the agent’s actions).
- Relation to SL: The human feedback resembles the labels in SL, providing a form of supervised guidance within the RL framework.

While RLHF is technically a subset of RL, it incorporates SL-like elements to make the learning process more efficient. It’s widely used in fine-tuning models like chatbots and language models, where human preferences shape the model’s behavior.

## Other aspects (Brainstorm)

- Transfer learning: existing model’s weights or architecture serve as a starting point
- model distillation: the new model (student) learns from the outputs or knowledge of the existing model (teacher), leveraging its learned patterns without starting from scratch
- Fine-tuning: adapting pretrained models
- qualitative learning feedback: Preference Learning, Direct Assessment, Reward Modeling


## Conclusion

Supervised learning and reinforcement learning are two pillars of machine learning, each tailored to different types of problems:

- SL excels with structured, labeled data and is ideal for prediction tasks.
- RL thrives in interactive, decision-making environments where long-term rewards guide learning.

Hybrids like RLHF and supervised reinforcement learning blend the strengths of both paradigms, offering more efficient learning in complex scenarios. Understanding these paradigms is crucial for grasping how modern AI systems, including those with chain-of-thought reasoning, are developed and optimized. Recent advancements using pure RL for logical reasoning underscore the evolving landscape of machine learning, where models can now trade inference time for greater accuracy, pushing the boundaries of AI performance.
