# Agent Engineering Tools

## Infrastructure Layers

1. Base Layer: LLM Access
2. Middle Layer: Agent/Chain Primitives
3. Top Layer: Pre-built Solutions

## General Notes

- Using agents to build agents (low code tools, Cursor ...)
- Frameworks overview: TensorFlow and PyTorch basics
- TensorFlow: structure and use cases
- PyTorch: flexibility and dynamic computation
- LangChain: building agents and orchestrating LLM workflows
- Hugging Face (models), ONNX (interoperability), Replicate (hosting models)

## LangChain Building Blocks

### Core Components
- Tools (atomic operations)
- Chains (composed operations)
- Agents (autonomous orchestrators)
- Memory systems

### Composition Patterns
- Hierarchical tool composition
- Chain nesting and reuse
- Agent-tool interaction
- Flow definition and control
